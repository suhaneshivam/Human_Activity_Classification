# Human_Activity_Classification
The model can be used to classify over 400 different human activities. eg . Archery ,Ice skating ,Sailing ect. The model used 3D convolution instead of 2D to take spatio-temporal
dimension into account. A pretrained 3D ResNet is used for classification purpose.


# Dataset
Dataset which was used to train the ResNet
1. 400 human activity recognition classes
2. At least 400 video clips per class (downloaded via YouTube)
3. A total of 300,000 videos

#Accuracy
Our human activity recognition model can recognize over 400 activities with 78.4-94.5% accuracy (depending on the task).
